# Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to 1000. Print your result on a single line, and use the ampersand (&) character as your separator (instead of a space).

# For example, the output for all prime numbers <=10 would be:
# 2&3&5&7

# a number ‘n’ is prime if it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and n. 
# In other words a number is prime if it is not divisible by any number from 2 to n-1. 
# so, we have to run a loop from 2 to n-1 and If a number is divisible by any number from 2 to n-1 it is not a prime number.
